Certainly! I will construct a technical `README.md` for the `sidtool_experimental` project based on the file list and the general understanding of such projects. Since specific details of each file are not available, the descriptions will be based on typical functionalities these files might have in a SID emulation and sound synthesis context.

# README.md for Sidtool Experimental Project

## Overview
The Sidtool Experimental Project is a comprehensive emulation and interaction suite for the SID (Sound Interface Device) chip, famously used in the Commodore 64. This project aims to recreate the SID's functionality for sound synthesis, music composition, and exploration of the chip's architecture.

## File Descriptions
1. **voice.rb**
   - **Description**: Manages individual voices of the SID chip, each capable of producing a waveform.
   - **Key Functionalities**: 
     - Voice Initialization and Configuration.
     - ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) Envelope Processing.

2. **synth.rb**
   - **Description**: Handles the synthesis part, generating audio waveforms based on input parameters.
   - **Key Functionalities**: 
     - Waveform Generation (e.g., square, triangle, sawtooth).
     - Low-Frequency Oscillator (LFO) for modulation effects.

3. **state.rb**
   - **Description**: Manages the state of the emulation, maintaining the current settings, and statuses of various components.
