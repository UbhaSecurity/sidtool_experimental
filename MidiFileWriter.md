# Sidtool::MidiFileWriter Class

The `MidiFileWriter` class in the `Sidtool` module is designed to convert SID chip parameters to MIDI format for use in Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). This allows for importing the MIDI output into standard DAWs like Ableton, FL Studio, Logic Pro, etc. The class handles specific setups for filters, ring modulation controllers, and other SID chip characteristics to accurately replicate the SID chip's sound in a MIDI format.

## Constants for MIDI Controller Numbers

The class defines several constants for MIDI controller numbers, which are used for mapping various SID parameters to MIDI:

- `FILTER_CUTOFF_CONTROLLER`: MIDI CC 74 for filter cutoff.
- `FILTER_RESONANCE_CONTROLLER`: MIDI CC 71 for filter resonance.
- `OSC_SYNC_CONTROLLER`: MIDI CC 102 for oscillator sync (Placeholder value, adjustable based on MIDI setup).
- `RING_MOD_CONTROLLER`: MIDI CC 103 for ring modulation (Placeholder value, adjustable based on MIDI setup).
- `PULSE_WIDTH_CONTROLLER`: MIDI CC for pulse width modulation.
- `MAX_CUTOFF_FREQUENCY`: Maximum frequency for the filter cutoff, typical for MIDI devices.
- `MAX_RESONANCE`: Maximum resonance value, typical for MIDI devices.
- `FRAMES_PER_SECOND`: Frames per second, relevant for time-based calculations in SID.

Additionally, the class includes detailed tables for envelope rates (`ENVELOPE_RATES`), decay and release rates (`DECAY_RELEASE_RATES`), and attack rates (`ATTACK_RATES`). These are essential for replicating the SID chip's sound characteristics in MIDI format.

## SID to MIDI Note Table

`SID_TO_MIDI_NOTE_TABLE` is a constant within the `MidiFileWriter` class. It maps frequencies to MIDI note numbers based on the SID chip's frequency generation capabilities and the MIDI standard's note numbering.

## Class Initialization

The `initialize` method sets up the `MidiFileWriter` with necessary components for SID-to-MIDI conversion, taking parameters for different voices of the SID chip, the SID chip itself, and CIA timers.

## MIDI File Writing

The `write_to` method writes the MIDI data to a specified file path, converting the SID synthesizer data into MIDI tracks and saving them in a MIDI file format.

## MIDI Event Structures

The class includes several structures for MIDI events like `ControlChange`, `DeltaTime`, `TrackName`, `TimeSignature`, `KeySignature`, `EndOfTrack`, `ProgramChange`, `NoteOn`, and `NoteOff`. These structures are used to represent different MIDI messages and their specific data formats.

## MIDI Track Construction

Methods like `build_track`, `handle_adsr`, `map_envelope_to_midi`, and others are responsible for constructing a MIDI track from SID voice data, including translating waveforms, envelope parameters, and effects into MIDI messages.

## Consolidating MIDI Events

The `consolidate_events` method optimizes MIDI data by streamlining tracks and removing redundant events, specifically targeting NoteOff and NoteOn events for the same note.

## Writing MIDI Data

Methods `write_header`, `write_track`, `write_uint32`, `write_uint16`, and `write_byte` handle the actual writing of MIDI data to a file, including headers, track data, and specific MIDI byte formats.

## Waveform to MIDI Channel Mapping

`map_waveform_to_channel` assigns MIDI channels based on the waveform of a SID voice, helping to recreate the unique sound characteristics of SID waveforms in MIDI format.
