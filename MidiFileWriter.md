# Sidtool::MidiFileWriter Class

This class is designed to convert SID chip parameters to MIDI format for use in a DAW. The MIDI file output can be imported into any standard DAW (like Ableton, FL Studio, Logic Pro, etc.). To accurately replicate the SID chip's sound, specific setups for filters and ring modulation controllers are required in your DAW.

## FILTER_CUTOFF_CONTROLLER and FILTER_RESONANCE_CONTROLLER

- These constants represent the MIDI CC (Control Change) messages for filter parameters.
- The `FILTER_CUTOFF_CONTROLLER` (CC 74) and `FILTER_RESONANCE_CONTROLLER` (CC 71) should be mapped to corresponding controls in your VST synthesizer plugin.
- Ensure your VST plugin accurately emulates the SID chip's filter characteristics.
- In your DAW, assign these controllers to the filter cutoff and resonance parameters in your VST plugin.
- This setup will allow dynamic control over the filter aspects of the SID sound, essential for achieving the characteristic SID tone.

## OSC_SYNC_CONTROLLER and RING_MOD_CONTROLLER

- `OSC_SYNC_CONTROLLER` and `RING_MOD_CONTROLLER` are custom MIDI CC values for oscillator sync and ring modulation effects.
- Assign these controllers to the corresponding parameters in your VST plugin that simulates the SID chip.
- `OSC_SYNC_CONTROLLER` (CC 102) and `RING_MOD_CONTROLLER` (CC 103) should control the oscillator synchronization and ring modulation effects, respectively.
- If your VST plugin does not have dedicated controls for these effects, you may need to map these controllers to the closest equivalent parameters.
- In your DAW, fine-tune these parameters to match the behavior of the original SID chip as closely as possible.

## General DAW Setup

- Upon importing the MIDI file, ensure each track is assigned to a separate instance or channel of your VST plugin.
- Set up your VST plugin with the initial parameters that best emulate the SID chip's sound.
- Use the MIDI CC automation lanes in your DAW to control the filter and ring modulation parameters dynamically during playback.
- Experiment with different settings and listen to the output to closely match the iconic SID sound.

**Note:** The effectiveness of the MIDI file in replicating the SID sound will greatly depend on the accuracy and capabilities of the chosen VST plugin.
