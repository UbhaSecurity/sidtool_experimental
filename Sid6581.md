# Sid6581 Class

The `Sid6581` class is a part of the `Sidtool` module and represents an emulator for the MOS Technology 6581 SID (Sound Interface Device) chip. This class emulates the functionality of the SID chip, which was used in the Commodore 64 and other vintage computers for generating sound and music.

Register Addresses
The SID chip has various registers used for controlling its behavior. The class defines constants for these register addresses:

Frequency Low Registers (FREQ_LO):

0xD400: Voice 1 Frequency Low

0xD402: Voice 1 Pulse Width Low
0xD409: Voice 2 Pulse Width Low

Pulse Width High Registers (PW_HI):

0xD403: Voice 1 Pulse Width High
0xD40A: Voice 2 Pulse Width High
0xD411: Voice 3 Pulse Width High
Control Registers (CR):

0xD404: Voice 1 Control Register
0xD40B: Voice 2 Control Register
0xD412: Voice 3 Control Register
Attack/Decay Registers (AD):

0xD405: Voice 1 Attack/Decay Register
0xD40C: Voice 2 Attack/Decay Register
0xD413: Voice 3 Attack/Decay Register
Sustain/Release Registers (SR):

0xD406: Voice 1 Sustain/Release Register
0xD40D: Voice 2 Sustain/Release Register
0xD414: Voice 3 Sustain/Release Register
Filter Cutoff Low Register (FC_LO):

0xD415: Filter Cutoff Low Register
Filter Cutoff High Register (FC_HI):

0xD416: Filter Cutoff High Register
Resonance/Filter Register (RES_FILT):

0xD417: Resonance/Filter Register
Mode/Volume Register (MODE_VOL):

0xD418: Mode/Volume Register
Potentiometer X Register (POTX):

0xD419: Potentiometer X Register
Potentiometer Y Register (POTY):

0xD41A: Potentiometer Y Register
Oscillator 3 Register (OSC3):

0xD41B: Oscillator 3 Register
Envelope 3 Register (ENV3):

0xD41C: Envelope 3 Register


## Constants

```ruby
WAVEFORM_TRIANGLE = 0x01
WAVEFORM_SAWTOOTH = 0x02
WAVEFORM_PULSE = 0x04
WAVEFORM_NOISE = 0x08
These constants represent the different waveform types that can be generated by the SID chip.

Register Addresses
The SID chip has various registers used for controlling its behavior. The class defines constants for these register addresses:

ruby
Copy code
FREQ_LO = [0xD400, 0xD407, 0xD40E]
FREQ_HI = [0xD401, 0xD408, 0xD40F]
PW_LO   = [0xD402, 0xD409, 0xD410]
PW_HI   = [0xD403, 0xD40A, 0xD411]
CR      = [0xD404, 0xD40B, 0xD412]
AD      = [0xD405, 0xD40C, 0xD413]
SR      = [0xD406, 0xD40D, 0xD414]
These constants represent the memory addresses of registers for configuring various aspects of the SID chip, such as frequency, pulse width, control settings, attack/decay, and sustain/release.

ruby
Copy code
FC_LO      = 0xD415
FC_HI      = 0xD416
RES_FILT   = 0xD417
MODE_VOL   = 0xD418
POTX       = 0xD419
POTY       = 0xD41A
OSC3       = 0xD41B
ENV3       = 0xD41C
These constants represent additional registers used for controlling filter parameters, volume, and other settings.

Initialization
ruby
Copy code
def initialize
  @voices = Array.new(3) { |voice_number| Voice.new(self, voice_number) }
  @global_filter_cutoff = 0
  @global_filter_resonance = 0
  @global_volume = 0
end
In the constructor, the Sid6581 object is initialized with three Voice objects (representing the three sound channels of the SID chip) and default values for global filter cutoff, resonance, and volume.

Writing to SID Registers
ruby
Copy code
def write_register(address, value)
  case address
  # Handling for various register addresses
  # ...
  end
end
The write_register method allows you to write values to specific SID registers. Depending on the register address, it updates the corresponding properties of the voices or global settings.

Reading from SID Registers
ruby
Copy code
def read_sid_register(address)
  case address
  # Handling for various register addresses
  # ...
  else
    # Handle unsupported SID register or other errors
    handle_sid_register_error(address)
    return 0x00  # You can return a default value or handle errors as needed
  end
end
The read_sid_register method retrieves values from specific SID registers. It maps register addresses to the relevant properties or returns a default value in case of unsupported addresses.

Handling SID Register Errors
ruby
Copy code
def handle_sid_register_error(address)
  # You can implement custom error handling logic here
  # For example, you can raise an exception or log the error
  raise "Unsupported SID register address: #{address}"
end
The handle_sid_register_error method is called when an unsupported SID register address is encountered. It provides a way to implement custom error handling logic, such as raising exceptions or logging errors.

Sound Generation and Processing
ruby
Copy code
def generate_sound
  # Iterate over each voice to generate sound
  @voices.each do |voice|
    voice.finish_frame
  end
end
The generate_sound method is responsible for generating sound frames for each voice. It invokes the finish_frame method of each voice.

ruby
Copy code
def process_audio(sample_rate)
  @voices.each do |voice|
    # Calculate phase, generate waveform, apply ADSR, and process further
  end
end
The process_audio method is used for processing audio samples. It calculates the phase for each voice, generates waveforms, applies Attack/Decay/Sustain/Release (ADSR) envelopes, and performs additional processing like applying global filters.

Private Methods
ruby
Copy code
private

def calculate_phase(voice, sample_rate)
  # Calculate and update phase for a voice
end
The calculate_phase method calculates and updates the phase of a voice based on the sample rate and frequency.

This documentation provides a detailed overview of the Sid6581 class, explaining its constants, register addresses, initialization, register read/write operations, error handling, and sound generation/processing. It serves as a comprehensive technical reference for developers working with the SID emulator.
