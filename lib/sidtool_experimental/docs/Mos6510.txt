Memory Map:
-----------
- Addressable External Memory: 0000 - FFFF
- Stack: 0100 - 01FF
- Page 0: 0000 - 00FF
- Page 1: 0100 - 01FF
- Output Register: 0001
- Data Direction Register: 0000

Applications Notes:
-------------------
Locating the Output Register at the internal I/O Port in Page Zero enhances the powerful Zero Page Addressing instructions of the 6510. By assigning the I/O Pins as inputs (using the Data Direction Register), the user has the ability to change the contents of address 0001 (the Output Register) using peripheral devices. The ability to change these contents using peripheral inputs, together with Zero Page Indirect Addressing instructions, allows novel and versatile programming techniques not possible earlier.
