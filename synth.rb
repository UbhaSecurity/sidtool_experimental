# Sidtool::Synth Class
# 
# The Synth class includes an LFO (Low-Frequency Oscillator) which is a crucial element in 
# sound synthesis and modulation. The LFO in this class is designed to modulate various 
# parameters of the synthesizer, adding dynamic and expressive characteristics to the sound.
#
# LFO Overview:
# - Low Frequency: Operates below human hearing threshold, typically below 20 Hz.
# - Oscillator: Regularly varies over time, influencing other sound parameters.
#
# LFO Parameters:
# 1. Rate/Speed: Determines the oscillation speed. Faster rate equals rapid modulation.
# 2. Depth/Intensity: Controls the extent of the LFO's effect on the modulated parameter.
# 3. Waveform: Shapes of the wave (sine, square, triangle, etc.) affect the modulation style.
# 4. Phase: Starting point in the waveformâ€™s cycle, useful for synchronization.
# 5. Destination: The parameter being modulated (e.g., pitch, volume, filter cutoff).
#
# LFO Uses in Synths:
# - Modulating synth parameters like pitch, amplitude, filter cutoff for effects like vibrato, tremolo, wah-wah.
# - Applying to audio effect parameters, creating dynamic effects.
# - Serving as an alternative to manual automation in DAWs.
# - Creating rhythmic elements by syncing to the track's tempo.
# - Expanding sound design possibilities with evolving textures and patterns.
#
# Advanced Techniques:
# - LFO on LFO: Complex modulations by applying an LFO to another LFO's parameters.
# - Envelope-Controlled LFOs: Using envelopes to dynamically control LFO settings.
# - MIDI Sync: Ensuring rhythmic consistency by syncing LFOs to the MIDI clock.
#
# Usage Tips:
# - Use subtlety for modulation depth.
# - Experiment with different waveforms for varied effects.
# - Consider the mix impact of LFO-modulated tracks.
# - Utilize automation for LFO parameter variation.

# handle_attack_decay_sustain_release Method
    #
    # This method manages the mapping of the SID's ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) parameters to MIDI control messages.
    # The ADSR envelope is a fundamental component in sound synthesis, shaping the amplitude envelope of a sound.
    #
    # ADSR Overview:
    # - Attack: Time it takes for the sound to reach its maximum level after a key is pressed.
    # - Decay: Time for the sound to decrease to the sustain level after the initial peak.
    # - Sustain: The level at which the sound remains after the decay phase, as long as the key is held down.
    # - Release: Time for the sound to fade to silence after the key is released.
    #
    # The method converts ADSR values into MIDI controller messages, which can be interpreted by MIDI-enabled devices or software.
    # These messages allow for dynamic control over sound shaping in a MIDI environment.
    #
    # Usage Notes:
    # - Each ADSR phase can be mapped to a specific MIDI controller number.
    # - The method scales the ADSR parameters to fit the MIDI controller value range (0-127).
    # - This implementation provides a basic mapping which can be adjusted according to specific needs or hardware/software specifications.
    #
    # The ADSR envelope is crucial for adding expressiveness and dynamic characteristics to the synthesized sound.
