# MOS 6510 CPU Emulator (Mos6510)

The `Mos6510` class is a Ruby-based emulator for the MOS 6510 microprocessor, which was used in the Commodore 64 computer. 
This emulator allows you to simulate the behavior of the MOS 6510 CPU and execute instructions just like the real processor.

## Features

- Supports various addressing modes and instructions of the MOS 6510 processor.
- Provides methods for fetching and setting memory.
- Emulates the CPU registers and flags, allowing you to inspect and modify their values.
- Allows you to reset the CPU to its initial state.
- Supports running a specified number of CPU cycles to simulate program execution.

## Installation

To use the `Mos6510` class in your Ruby project, you can simply include it in your code. There are no additional dependencies required.

```ruby
require 'mos6510'

# Create a new instance of the Mos6510 class with memory
memory = Array.new(65536, 0) # Initialize a 64KB memory
cpu = Mos6510::Mos6510.new(memory)

# Load a program into memory (not shown in this example)
# ...

# Reset the CPU to its initial state
cpu.reset

# Run the CPU for a specified number of cycles
cpu.run_cycles(100)

# Access CPU registers and flags
a_register = cpu.a
x_register = cpu.x
flags = cpu.p # Flags are stored in an 8-bit value

# Fetch and set memory values
memory_value = cpu.get_mem(0x1000)
cpu.set_mem(0x1000, 0xFF)

Please note that this is a basic example, and a complete program would typically involve loading a program into memory and executing it step by step.

Supported Instructions
The Mos6510 class supports a wide range of instructions provided by the MOS 6510 microprocessor. 
These instructions are defined in the INSTRUCTIONS dictionary within the class, along with their opcodes, addressing modes, and operation methods.

Refer to the class source code and the MOS 6510 processor documentation for a comprehensive list of supported instructions.
