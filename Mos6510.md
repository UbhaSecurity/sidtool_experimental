# MOS 6510 CPU Emulator (Mos6510)

The `Mos6510` class is a Ruby-based emulator for the MOS 6510 microprocessor, which was used in the Commodore 64 computer. 
This emulator allows you to simulate the behavior of the MOS 6510 CPU and execute instructions just like the real processor.

## Features

- Supports various addressing modes and instructions of the MOS 6510 processor.
- Provides methods for fetching and setting memory.
- Emulates the CPU registers and flags, allowing you to inspect and modify their values.
- Allows you to reset the CPU to its initial state.
- Supports running a specified number of CPU cycles to simulate program execution.

## Installation

To use the `Mos6510` class in your Ruby project, you can simply include it in your code. There are no additional dependencies required.

```ruby
require 'mos6510'

# Create a new instance of the Mos6510 class with memory
memory = Array.new(65536, 0) # Initialize a 64KB memory
cpu = Mos6510::Mos6510.new(memory)

# Load a program into memory (not shown in this example)
# ...

# Reset the CPU to its initial state
cpu.reset

# Run the CPU for a specified number of cycles
cpu.run_cycles(100)

# Access CPU registers and flags
a_register = cpu.a
x_register = cpu.x
flags = cpu.p # Flags are stored in an 8-bit value

# Fetch and set memory values
memory_value = cpu.get_mem(0x1000)
cpu.set_mem(0x1000, 0xFF)
```

Supported Instructions

The Mos6510 class supports a wide range of instructions provided by the MOS 6510 microprocessor. 
These instructions are defined in the INSTRUCTIONS dictionary within the class, along with their opcodes, addressing modes, and operation methods.

Refer to the class source code and the MOS 6510 processor documentation for a comprehensive list of supported instructions.

## Missing Features

The Mos6510 class is a CPU emulator for the MOS 6510 microprocessor, but there are some features and implementations that are missing or could be improved. 
Here's a list of missing features and potential improvements:

Memory Management:

Currently, the emulator assumes a fixed memory size of 64KB, initialized with zeros. A more flexible memory management system allowing dynamic memory allocation would be beneficial.
Load and Run Programs:

While the class provides methods to interact with memory, it doesn't demonstrate how to load and run programs on the CPU. Including examples or methods for loading machine code programs into memory and executing them would be useful.
Interrupt Handling:

The MOS 6510 supports various interrupt types (IRQ, NMI, BRK), and handling interrupts is an essential part of a CPU emulator. Implementing interrupt handling and the associated interrupt vectors would make the emulator more complete.
Debugging Support:

Adding debugging features like breakpoints, step-by-step execution, and memory inspection tools can aid in debugging programs running on the emulator.
Timing and Clock Cycle Accuracy:

For more accurate emulation, timing and clock cycle counting should be considered. Currently, the emulator does not model cycle-accurate behavior.
Optimizations:

Depending on the use case, there might be opportunities for optimizations in the emulator's performance, especially for emulating complex instructions.
Documentation:

Although a basic README.md is provided, more comprehensive documentation with examples, usage guides, and explanations of CPU internals would be beneficial for users.
Test Suite:

A test suite with unit tests and integration tests can help ensure the correctness of the emulator and detect regressions when making changes or improvements.
Support for Custom Hardware:

If you're emulating a complete system like the Commodore 64, consider adding support for sound and video emulation to provide a more authentic experience.
